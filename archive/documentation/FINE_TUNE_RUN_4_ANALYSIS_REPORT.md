| **Run 4** | **0.271** | **87.50%** | **Best** |

**Key Trade-off**: Run 4 achieved best validation performance but at the cost of training stability and performance.

### 🔸 Training Efficiency

| Run | Total Steps | Expected Steps | Efficiency |
|-----|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Run 2 | 683 | ~350 | Poor (94% overage) |
| Run 3 | 291 | ~280 | Excellent (4% overage) |
| Run 4 | 560 | ~560 | Expected (2 epochs) |

**Run 4 Analysis**: Used expected number of steps for 2-epoch training (1.9x Run 3).

### 🔸 Epoch-by-Epoch Analysis (Run 4 Only)

| Epoch | Steps | Start Loss | End Loss | Improvement | Oscillations | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|

|-----|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Run 2 | 69 (10.1%) | 1 (0.1%) | Basic |
| Run 3 | 30 (10.3%) | 1 (0.3%) | Basic |
| **Run 4** | 56 (10.0%) | **2 (0.4%)** | **Enhanced** |

**✅ POSITIVE**: Run 4 achieved 2x better full validation coverage, providing better monitoring.

## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Training Curve Characteristics

**Run 3 (Baseline)**: 
- Smooth, consistent improvement
- Low volatility (mean=0.0254)
- Stable convergence

**Run 4 (Optimized)**:
- Higher volatility (mean=0.0244 but 517 oscillations)
- Two-phase behavior: improvement then degradation
- Unstable convergence pattern

### Validation vs Training Performance Gap

| Run | Train Acc | Valid Acc | Gap | Overfitting Risk |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----|------------------|
| Run 3 | 84.44% | 86.46% | +2.02% | Low |
| **Run 4** | 83.33% | **87.50%** | **+4.17%** | **Moderate** |

**Concern**: Run 4 shows larger validation-training gap, suggesting potential overfitting.

## Configuration Impact Analysis

### Learning Rate Impact (0.5 → 0.75)

| Metric | Run 3 (lr=0.5) | Run 4 (lr=0.75) | Change | Assessment |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------|------------|
| Oscillations | 269 | 517 | +92% | ❌ Much worse |
| Training Stability | High | Low | -↓ | ❌ Degraded |
| Validation Performance | 86.46% | 87.50% | +1.2% | ✅ Improved |

**Conclusion**: Learning rate 0.75 is **too high** - causes instability despite validation gains.

### Epoch Count Impact (1 → 2)

| Phase | Performance Trend | Conclusion |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| Epoch 1 | ✅ Improvement (+1.8%) | Beneficial |
| Epoch 2 | ❌ Degradation (-5.2%) | Harmful |

**Conclusion**: Second epoch caused **overfitting** - should revert to 1 epoch.

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Immediate Actions

1. **REDUCE Learning Rate**
   - Target: **0.6** (between successful 0.5 and problematic 0.75)
   - Rationale: Balance stability with performance gains

2. **REVERT to 1 Epoch**
   - Evidence: Epoch 2 showed clear degradation (-5.2%)
   - Avoid overfitting observed in Run 4

3. **KEEP Enhanced Validation**
   - 18% stratified validation monitoring
   - Proved valuable for detecting overfitting

4. **KEEP Data Balancing**
   - Moderate 2x weights strategy
   - No evidence of problems

### 🧪 Next Experiment Series

**Run 5 (Recommended Next)**:
```yaml
Learning Rate: 0.6
Epochs: 1
Batch Size: 64
Data Balancing: moderate (2x weights)
Validation: 18% enhanced stratified
Expected Outcome: Better stability than Run 4, similar validation performance
```

**Run 6 (If Run 5 succeeds)**:
```yaml
Learning Rate: 0.6
Epochs: 1.5
Batch Size: 64
Early Stopping: validation loss plateau
Expected Outcome: Optimal balance of all metrics
```

### 🔧 Advanced Optimizations

1. **Implement Early Stopping**
   - Monitor validation loss
   - Stop if no improvement for 20 steps

2. **Learning Rate Scheduling**
   - Start at 0.6, decay to 0.4
   - May achieve stability with performance

3. **Gradient Clipping**
   - Limit gradient norms to reduce oscillations
   - Particularly useful with higher learning rates

## Conclusion

The **"balanced_optimal" configuration used in Run 4 did not achieve its intended goals**. While it delivered the best validation performance (87.50% accuracy), this came at an unacceptable cost to training stability (+92% oscillations) and training performance (-1.3% accuracy).

**Key Lessons Learned**:
1. **Learning rate 0.75 is too aggressive** for this model/dataset combination
2. **Two epochs cause overfitting** - the second epoch showed clear performance degradation
3. **Enhanced validation monitoring is valuable** and should be retained
4. **There's a clear trade-off** between validation performance and training stability

**Recommended Path Forward**: Use Run 5 configuration (lr=0.6, 1 epoch) to find the optimal balance between the stability of Run 3 and the validation performance of Run 4.
