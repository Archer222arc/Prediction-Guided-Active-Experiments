OVERALL CONCLUSION: MIXED RESULTS - NOT OPTIMAL

The optimized configuration (lr=0.75, 2 epochs) did NOT achieve the goal of 
"better performance while maintaining stability". Key findings:

NEGATIVES:
- 92% MORE oscillations than Run 3 (517 vs 269)
- Lower training accuracy (83.33% vs 84.44%)
- Higher final training loss (0.317 vs 0.286)
- Second epoch showed degradation (potential overfitting)

POSITIVES:
- Better validation performance (87.50% vs 86.46% accuracy)
- Lower validation loss (0.271 vs 0.288)
- Improved validation monitoring (2x full validations)
- Still much more stable than Run 2 (21% fewer oscillations)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. REDUCE learning rate to 0.6 or lower (0.75 is too high)
2. REVERT to 1 epoch training (2 epochs caused overfitting)
3. KEEP enhanced validation monitoring (18% stratified)
4. KEEP moderate data balancing (2x weights)

NEXT EXPERIMENTS:
- Run 5: lr=0.6, 1 epoch, same validation/balancing
- Run 6: lr=0.5, 1.5 epochs if Run 5 succeeds
- Implement early stopping based on validation loss

CONFIGURATION RANKING (best to worst):
1. Run 3 (Fixed): lr=0.5, 1 epoch - BEST STABILITY
2. Run 4 (Optimized): lr=0.75, 2 epochs - BEST VALIDATION  
3. Run 2 (Problematic): lr=1.5, 1 epoch - WORST OVERALL

OPTIMAL NEXT CONFIG:
- Learning rate: 0.6 (between successful 0.5 and problematic 0.75)
- Epochs: 1 (avoid overfitting seen in epoch 2)
- Validation: Keep enhanced 18% stratified
- Data balancing: Keep moderate 2x weights
